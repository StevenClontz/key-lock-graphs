    "Given a walk $W$ in a key-lock graph using a lock edge $L$, let $W_L$ be the initial subwalk of $W$ that ends right before $L$ is first used, and $W_L^+$ be the initial subwalk of $W$ that ends right after $L$ is first used.\n",

    "\n",
    "A key-lock graph $G$ is $SK_2$ if and only if every greedy walk is admissible.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Proof\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $G$ be $SK_2$ and $W$ be a greedy walk. If $W$ wasn't admissible, it must have used a lock $L$ such that $k(W_L^+)<l(W_L^+)$; let $L$ be the first such lock, so $W_L$ is a partial admissible walk with $k(W_L)=l(W_L)$. By $SK_2$, $W_L$ must be able to extend to an admissible walk that includes one new lock edge. But by greedy, $W_L$ cannot be extended to reach any new key vertices without first using a new lock edge, a contradiction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now assume every greedy walk is admissible, and let $W$ be a partial admissible walk. Let $W$ first pass through the locks\n",
    "$L_0,\\dots,L_{n-1}$ in that order, and has not yet passed through some reachable lock $L_n$. Consider any greedy, and thus admissible, walk $V$ that first passes through the locks $L_0,\\dots,L_{n-1},L_n$ in that order. Then consider $WW^{-1}V$, which walks along $W$, then in the reverse direction back to $s_G$, and then along $V$. This extension of $W$ is admissible, and uses a new lock $L_n$, proving $SK_2$."
