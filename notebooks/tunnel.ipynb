    "\n",
    "A tunnel graph is $SK_2$ if and only if it is $SK_1$ if and only if it is well-keyed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $SK_2\\Rightarrow SK_1$ for any graph. So let\n",
    "$G$ satisfy $SK_1$; we will prove it is well-keyed. Note that if\n",
    "the graph has $N=0$ locks, it is well-keyed vacuously.\n",
    "\n",
    "So suppose the inequality holds for $N$ locks; we will show it holds for $N+1$ locks.\n",
    "So given a tunnel graph $G$ with $N+1$ locks $L_0,\\dots,L_N$ and $N+2$ regions\n",
    "$R_0,\\dots,R_{N+1}$ which is $SK_1$, let $W$ be a admissible walk that passes\n",
    "through all $N+1$ locks. Consider the subgraph $G'$ of $G$ induced by\n",
    "$\\bigcup_{n=0}^N R_n$ (that is, deleting $L_N$ and $R_{N+1}$).\n",
    "Note that $G'$ is an tunnel graph with $N+1$ regions and\n",
    "$N$ locks, and if we let $W'$ be the initial subwalk of $W$ removing the first vertex of $R_{N+1}$\n",
    "and all following vertices, then $W'$ is an admissible walk over $G'$, showing $G'$ is $SK_1$.\n",
    "Thus by the induction hypothesis, $G'$ (and thus $G$) satisfies the inequalities\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sum_{n=0}^{M} k(R_n) \\geq M + 1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "for all $0\\leq M < N$. It remains to be shown that\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sum_{n=0}^{N} k(R_n) \\geq N + 1.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "But we have that $W$ is an admissible walk, and if we let $W''$ be the\n",
    "initial subwalk of $W$ removing all vertices following the first vertex of $R_{N+1}$,\n",
    "we must have $k(W'')\\geq l(W'')$. Thus we may conclude\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sum_{n=0}^{N} k(R_n) \\geq\n",

    "admissible walk; we will show that it can be extended to use one more\n",

    "\n",
    "If $G$ has $N$ locks and $N+1$ regions, then $W$ uses $M$ lock edges for\n",
    "some $M<N$; in particular, it must use the lock edges $L_0,\\dots,L_{M-1}$.\n",
    "It follows that it includes vertices in regions $R_m$ for all\n",
    "$0\\leq m\\leq M$. Thus it may be extended to an admissible walk $W'$ that\n",
    "includes all vertices in those regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the graph is well-keyed, there exist at least $M+1$ keys in these\n",
